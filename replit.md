# Overview

This is a Discord bot called "Hail Mary AI Roast Bot" that generates AI-powered roasts for users. The bot integrates with Discord's API to receive commands and responds with creative roasts generated by an external AI service. It's designed to provide entertainment through humorous, AI-generated content while maintaining appropriate boundaries in Discord servers.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Bot Framework
- **Discord.py Library**: Uses the discord.py library with the commands extension for structured command handling and event processing
- **Command-Based Architecture**: Implements a command prefix system ('!') for user interactions
- **Event-Driven Design**: Utilizes Discord's event system (on_ready, message events) for responsive bot behavior

## Authentication & Configuration
- **Environment Variable Management**: Stores sensitive credentials (Discord bot token, AI API credentials) as environment variables for security
- **Runtime Validation**: Performs startup validation of required environment variables with proper error handling and logging

## AI Integration
- **External AI API**: Integrates with a third-party AI service through HTTP requests to generate roast content
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Uses async/await patterns for non-blocking API calls and Discord operations
- **Error Handling**: Implements proper exception handling for AI API failures and network issues

## Logging & Monitoring
- **Structured Logging**: Uses Python's logging module with formatted output including timestamps and log levels
- **Operational Visibility**: Provides clear startup messages and error reporting for debugging and monitoring

## Security Considerations
- **Token Protection**: Keeps Discord bot tokens and API keys in environment variables rather than hardcoded values
- **Input Validation**: Validates environment variables at startup to prevent runtime failures

# External Dependencies

## Discord Platform
- **Discord API**: Core integration for bot functionality, message handling, and server interactions
- **Discord.py Library**: Python wrapper for Discord's API providing bot commands and event handling

## AI Service Integration
- **External AI API**: Third-party AI service for generating roast content (configurable via AI_API_URL)
- **API Authentication**: Requires API key authentication for AI service access

## Runtime Environment
- **Python Runtime**: Built on Python with async/await support for concurrent operations
- **Environment Variables**: Requires DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN, AI_API_URL, and AI_API_KEY configuration
- **HTTP Client**: Uses requests library for external API communications

## Development Dependencies
- **Logging Framework**: Python's built-in logging module for operational monitoring
- **OS Module**: For environment variable access and system integration
